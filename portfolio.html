Through the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript I've obtained more practice with user inputs, storing user input values, and displaying the output on the page. I've also had a better understanding with the .append() method in Javascript which is used to add data to a file. </p>

Users are also able to add their own images to this gallery by inserting a link.
